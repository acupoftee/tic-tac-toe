## Planning
The design was inspired by [Google's in browser tic tac toe game](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&ei=rtIaXevbFqOOgge_95joDw&q=tic+tac+toe&oq=tic+tac+toe&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l10.714.1723..1817...0.0..0.62.594.11......0....1..gws-wiz.....0..0i131j0i10.D3ny-Yte1nw). Their simple design and engaging animations made for fun animation practice along the way! This was made using responsible mobile first design principles. This was also a great opportunity to become familiar with Bootstrap by using a simple design.

Problem solving strategies involved were first creating a plan on paper, then translating it into psuedocode, and finally coded the solution. The [SEI issue tracker](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/game-project/issues) helped with arriving at solutions with my own approach.

### Wireframes
Here are the original wireframes for this project. The design deviated from this throughout the project. This only served as a starting point.

### User Stories
This shaped the feature development for the game:

1. As a user, I want to play tic tac toe with another user side by side.
2. As a user, I want to be able to sign in to tic tac toe so that I can save my game statistics.
3. As a user, I want to see when I've won or lost a game.
4. As a user, I want to sign out of my account with saved progress.
5. As a user, I want to make a new account for tic tac toe if I don't have one yet.

## Game Prospects
Improvements to be made are animations and/or style changes indicating who the winner is. There may also be improved responsive design so that this can be enjoyed on mobile as well.

Player stats should include a winrate or win/loss record for stats to be truly meaningful. This will entail improved win check methods that will properly use the API.

Lastly, an AI using the [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm would be a great addition for a single player.
